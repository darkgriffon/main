//as all params like closures and colors can be taken from info file e.g. CSS.plist
//according to document type it matched?
//and centralScanner used as many times as there are KEYS with PARAMS
//So then central dispatcher becomes file the doctype matches if found

//unless I want to hardcode this, or half hardcode since some Settings will be there
//but these are considered, ah almost forgot, This is JUST ONE central Coloring dispatcher
//If I would want to able to change it I will have to add more, it can't be hardcoded
//No, no way it can be hardcoded
