#TextEditor Project

## IDEA 
Basically trying to make my own text editor alternative to Sublime Text 2 and TextWrangler on Mac, Notepad++ on Windows.

## Why?
To Prove that I can, and because I like simplicity of Vim (in a way), Search and Replace Engine of Dreamweaver, Sublime Text versatility, and looks of Espresso from MacRabbit. None of them is perfect for me, so I decided to do mine.

## Platforms
OSX for now, as it seems most interesting and challenging.
