##More Detailed
###Programming languages I think I know pretty good:
* HTML/4/5 - I know it since time when table constructed pages were transitioned to div's up to responsive;
* CSS/2/3 - Pretty small I can say here, let's say I know when to use '>' and when it wouldn't be convenient to use CSS animation as it would be needed to be re-written in Javascript;   
* Javascript - Don't know what to say here either, I have self made gallery engine *here* that should give some intro, experienced enough to say Javascript is not jQuery;
* AJAX - this one is interesting, from simple in page non refresh up to CSFR request that worked only in IE (for internal stuff of course only);
* PHP/MySQL - Experience from simple based pages to frameworks such as CodeIgniter, Symfony, Laravel, Zend (before other three were still in nappies);
* Shell - just for anything;
* VBscript - In Windows, mainly creating some script that helped in life and workflow as alternative to Shell.

###Programming languages worked with:
* Java - Mainly to connect Front End on Internal systems;
* Python - with Django experience in couple projects too;
* Ruby - with RoR also couple internal projects, but I prefered Python. Finished http://railsforzombies.org
* .NET - Mainly with C# and again to connect Front End template with server side

###Programming languages I learned for fun:
C, Objective-C - Currently developing texteditor in my spare time for fun, you browse on here*
Python - very very versatile language, I love it because it can be bridge between server and shell, some experiments can be seen here*
